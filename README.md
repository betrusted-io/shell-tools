# shell-tools

POSIX shell tools for continuous integration (and other things)!

## Usage

### runtests

**runtests** will execute SCRIPT in each of the directories DIRS
and will return non-zero (fail) if any SCRIPT fails.

The SCRIPT could be an executable in the PATH, or an executable
relative to the directory (e.g. `./dut.py`) or a shell script
to be given to `sh -e -c SCRIPT` (_NOTE_ within SCRIPT the
variable **d** is set to the directory and the variable **i** is
set to the current number of the test running.

```
usage: runtests [OPTIONS] DIRS

           [-c,--script] SCRIPT  prog-or-script
       DIRS                      one or more directories to test
